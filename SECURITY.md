## Reporting a Bug

Report security bugs by emailing wes@wesleytodd.com.

To ensure the timely response to your report, please ensure that the entirety
of the report is contained within the email body and not solely behind a web
link or an attachment.

I will acknowledge your email within one week, and will send a
more detailed response within one week indicating the next steps in handling
your report. 

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Pre-release Versions

Alpha and Beta releases are unstable and **not suitable for production use**.
Vulnerabilities found in pre-releases should be reported according to the [Reporting a Bug](#reporting-a-bug) section.
Due to the unstable nature of the branch it is not guaranteed that any fixes will be released in the next pre-release.

## Threat Model

Each project may have it's own thread model. This reporting doc is shared among many projects, so please reference the
project specific thread model when available.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
